# Usage Guide

This tool is designed to be simple and direct. It requires minimal setup and interaction.

## Basic Usage

```bash
python3 patch.py your_app.apks
```

That's it. The tool does everything automatically.

## What the Tool Does

1. Extracts the base APK from the APKS file
2. Creates necessary library files
3. Disables PairIP protection mechanisms:
   - Patches native library loading
   - Bypasses signature verification
   - Removes license check activities
   - Modifies file paths for access
4. Rebuilds and signs the APK

## Example Output

```
$ python3 patch.py app.apks

All temporary files have been removed.
```

## Common Issues

### Missing JAR Files

Make sure APKEditor-1.4.3.jar and uber-apk-signer.jar are in the same directory as the script.

### Permission Issues

In Linux/Termux, make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x patch.py
```

### Java Memory Issues

For large APKs, you may need to increase Java's memory:
```bash
export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx2g"
```

## Getting the Patched APK

After successful patching, you'll find a file named `[original-name]-patched.apk` in the same directory. This is your patched APK with PairIP protection removed.
